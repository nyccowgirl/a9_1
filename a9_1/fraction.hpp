/*

 The Fraction class can be used to create objects that store a fraction, including numerator
 and denominator. The following functions are available:

 Fraction();
  post: The calling object has been created and initialized to 0/1.

 Fraction(int inNum, int inDenom);
  post: The calling object has been created and initialized so that the numerator is inNum,
        and the denominator is inDenom. If inDenom is 0, program is aborted.
 
 Fraction addedTo(Fraction &frac);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by adding the calling object with the paramenter "frac".
 
 Fraction subtract(Fraction &frac);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by subtracting the parameter "frac" from the
        calling object.
 
 Fraction multipliedBy(Fraction &frac);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by multiplying the calling object by the parameter
        "frac".
 
 Fraction dividedBy(Fraction &frac);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by dividing the calling object by the parameter
        "frac".
 
 bool isEqualTo(Fraction &frac);
  post: Returns true if the calling object is equal to the parameter "frac". Otherwise,
        returns false.

 void print() const;
  post: The calling object has been printed to the console window in the format N/D.
